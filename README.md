# DriverPass-Sytem


# Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?

This project was focused on interpreting a client's requests into a design for a system that was tailored towards helping kids pass their driving tests.  DriverPass wanted to build a website that mainly focused on having their customers login to view progress, reserve a driving lesson, and take practice tests.

# What did you do particularly well?

I think I gave a very detailed description of the technologies we would be utilizing in this project.  Showing just how simple it would be to use Google's Firebase platform to host and store everything needed for the website as well as seamless integration with Authentication.

# If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

The timeline that the team built I think is far too open ended.  I think we could tighten up things into hours rather than weeks on end, showing the overall project could take x many hours rather than 5 months.  Breaking up the tasks into subtasks to show the distribution of hours.

# How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

The end user is who you are building it for.  You want to stay close to what the client wants, but sometimes the client isn't thinking 5 steps ahead and not realizing what the end user is going to want.  

# How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?

Learning and understanding everything about the client's requirements before lifting a pencil to draw up any diagrams.  Knowing the whole picture is very important to build and design an integrative system.
